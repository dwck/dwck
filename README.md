## Data Science Projects

### 1) Rossmaan Sales Prediction

I have built a machine learning model to forecast each store's sales in the next six weeks. The proposed business challenge was to help the CFO having a sales prediction to make an accurate budget for the store's refurbishment.  

Overall, the performance of the model follows below:
