# Daniel's Portfolio

The main objective of my portfolio is to show my skill to solve business challenges through my data science knowledge and demonstrate I am ready to have a job in this field.  

## Daniel Werneck
### (Data Scientist)
I am a self-taught Data Scientist who has been studying it for over a year now. I am also a graduated Mechanical Engineer.
As you can see, I have finished my first project from a dataset available in Kaggle, and I went through all steps to help the business to make a better decision. These steps are from understanding the company and the available dataset to deploy the model into production using Clouds. 
The details of the project are available in the Rossmann sales prediction repository. 

Currently, I am developing my second project to expand my skills and knowledge. For now, the analytical tools that I know are:
- Data collection and storage: SQL.
- Data process and analysis: Python
- Development: Git
- Machine Learning Modelling: Regression
- Machine Learning Deployment: Heroku, Flask

## Data Science Projects

### 1) Rossmaan Sales Prediction

I have built a machine learning model to forecast each store's sales in the next six weeks. The proposed business challenge was to help the CFO having a sales prediction to make an accurate budget for the store's refurbishment.  

Overall, the performance of the model follows below:
